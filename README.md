# 📈 Quantitative Models for Stock Market Prediction  

> Bachelor's Thesis focused on quantitative modeling and machine learning techniques applied to financial market prediction.

---

## 📌 Overview  

This project analyzes and implements **quantitative models for stock market prediction**, combining statistical methods, time series analysis, and machine learning techniques.

The objective is to evaluate whether mathematical and data-driven models can generate predictive signals capable of outperforming baseline market assumptions.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Analyze financial time series behavior  
- Implement predictive quantitative models  
- Compare traditional statistical methods vs machine learning approaches  
- Evaluate forecasting accuracy  
- Assess model robustness and overfitting  

---

## 📊 Research Questions  

- Can historical price data predict future returns?  
- Do machine learning models outperform classical econometric models?  
- How does volatility impact predictive performance?  
- What is the trade-off between bias and variance in financial modeling?

## 🧠 Methodology  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection  

- Historical stock price data  
- Market indices  
- Volume and volatility indicators  
- Technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, etc.)  

---

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing  

- Cleaning missing values  
- Normalization and scaling  
- Feature engineering  
- Stationarity testing  

---

### 3️⃣ Models Implemented  

- 📉 Linear Regression  
- 📊 ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
- 📈 Logistic Regression (classification approach)  
- 🌲 Random Forest  
- 🧠 Neural Networks (if included)  

---

### 4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics  

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Accuracy (classification models)  
- Sharpe Ratio (if strategy-based evaluation included)  
- Backtesting performance

## 📈 Key Findings  

- Financial time series are highly noisy and partially unpredictable  
- Machine learning models may capture nonlinear patterns  
- Overfitting is a major risk in financial prediction  
- Proper validation and backtesting are critical  

---

## ⚠ Limitations  

- Market efficiency constraints  
- Limited predictive power of historical data  
- Sensitivity to market regime changes  
- Transaction costs not always fully captured  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements  

- Deep learning architectures (LSTM for time series)  
- Reinforcement learning trading strategies  
- Alternative data integration (news, sentiment analysis)  
- Regime-switching models
